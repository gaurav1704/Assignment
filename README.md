# Assignment
The assignment was assigned to me by White Panda Media Pvt. Ltd.

i have hard coded some of the things as i was testing the whole thing on my laptop and all of the interactive buttons are applicable only when used on laptop as they take input from the mouse pointer.

i am assuming the screen resolution is 1366*768 and it would be optimal on that resolution.

i also tried it using on the android version but some of the images get's distorted and the inputs are also not working.
